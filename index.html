            <h2> What do we do? </h2>
        
        <p> At GuitarHaven we are committed to making learning guitar as easy and as efficient as possible.
            We want to ensure that your guitar journey is interesting, and we want to make sure that you don't end up
            dropping the guitar out of frustration. Use this website as an aid to your learning experience. Make sure
            you bookmark this page as we will be updating the website regularly with news and learning exercises that will
            be beneficial to any guitar player, beginner or pro. </p>
        </section>
            
            <h2> Where to start?</h2>
            
        <p> If you are an absolute beginner it might be beneficial to look our Beginner Tabs section for some easy songs
         that you can play along to. Learning new songs is one of the best ways to learn the guitar, as there are many different techniques in each song that you can practice. If you never read tablature before don't worry, we go over how to read tablature in that section. Learning songs also motivates you further. There is no satisfaction like
         being able to play along with your favourite riffs. </p>
